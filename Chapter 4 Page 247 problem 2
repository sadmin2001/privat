/* Program to input uder height, weight, and age to output clothing size
 Pseudocode:
 Input: Heigh, Weight, Age
 Process: 
 Hat size ((Weight / Height) * 2.9 )
 Jacket Size (H * W) / 288 ) + ((1/8)*(a - 30))
 Waist Inches (Weight / 5.7) + ((1/10) * ((a-28) / 2) 
 Output "Your hat size is hat_size"
 "Your jacket size is jacket_size"
 "Your waist size is waist_size"
 "Would you like to go again?"
 
 Additional notes:
 Removed hard coded numbers
